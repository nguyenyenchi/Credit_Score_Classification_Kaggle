This repository is a data science project using a credit score dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification?datasetId=2289007&sortBy=commentCount). The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model which can classify the credit score given a personâ€™s credit-related information.

There are two files relating to two main tasks for this project:
